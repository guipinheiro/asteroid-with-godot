# Asteroid with Godot

## Goals

After learning the basic of Godot's game engine, now it's time to create a basic example of Asteroid game.

## Why create a replica of asteroids?

Well, Asteroid, even though a very simple game, can help me develop the basic principle of game design, development and learn how to use Godot to create a game from scratch.

My goals with this project will be:

### 1. No use of follow along tutorials

While very helpful, follow along tutorials create a dependence of the game developer. This happens because we, instead of try something from our heads, just copy and paste stuff, feelling like we have learned something. However, when trying to create, you see that you really don't know anything because we haven't had the struggle of real learning, try something, don't get it, research, try again, experiment, fail until you succeed.

Then, by not learning, you look for another tutorial (and another, and another) and stop trying thing for yourself, because you get afraid that you cannot do it alone and you step into the *Tutorial Hell*. I've did this many times and really didn't get any knowledge. However, I also had experience with PBL (Problem-Based Learning) that encourages someone into try to do anything by yourself, study it without any teachers doing a monologue on how to do it, and explain to others. When I studied under this approach, I felt like I really learned something. There were less hours of content exposition and more study and do it by yourself.

Thus, with what I've tried so far, I will try doing this game by myself. Of course, videos and guides like "how to create a sprite and load into godot" will be allowed. But no "how to make Asteroids in Godot".

### 2. Learning a bit of everything

With simplicity, comes also the desire of create and learn stuff out of my comfort zone. I'm no artist. Never got deep into drawing or music (even though tried to learn a little bit of both). So, instead of getting the assets from somewhere, I will attempt to make both the art and the SFX/music.

I decided to go with a pixel art approach, since it's a style that always got my attention and it's associated with old games. The software of choice will be [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/). There are a ton of guides and tutorials on how to use this tool and it was very cheap to get it (something around BRL 35.00 on Steam). For the sound, I still haven't decided, but I will update this document once I figure it out.

Other stuff game dev related that I will get to grasp when developing will be the basics of Godot game engine (working with physics, collision, importing stuff, creating UI, working with randomness, etc.). Small game, but so many things to do already, kinda frightening, but in the right level to keep me going without getting to hard or to easy (I guess?).

### 3. Motivation

Having something you created yourself has a powerfull sense of accomplishment to keep the motivation going on and to show the others. Besides, it is also a very powerful way of learning something by doing a project. So, let's do it!

## Tools

These are the tools I will be using through this project:

- [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) 4.4
- [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) 1.3.10
- [*Sound to be defined*]

## References

If I find any relevant tutorials, documentation, stackoverflow questions, I will be posting them here.
